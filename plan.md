# RACO Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for RACO (Ralf's AI Code Orchestrator), a console and web-based AI agent for application development with human-in-the-loop workflows.

## Implementation Philosophy

The implementation follows these guiding principles:
1. **Incremental development** - Build core functionality first, then extend
2. **Early demonstrator** - Create a minimal viable product quickly to validate the approach
3. **Requirement-driven** - Link all implementation steps to specific requirements
4. **Architecture alignment** - Ensure implementation adheres to the defined architecture
5. **Test-driven development** - Create tests before or alongside implementation
6. **Formal verification** - Apply formal verification techniques where possible to ensure correctness

## Infrastructure Setup

### Rust Workspace Structure

The RACO project will be structured as a Rust workspace with multiple smaller crates to enhance modularity, maintainability, and compilation speed. The workspace structure will be organized as follows:

```
raco/
├── Cargo.toml              # Workspace definition
├── .github/                # GitHub workflows
├── docs/                   # Documentation
│   └── source/             # Architecture and requirements docs

│   │       └── lib.rs      # Core library entry point
│   │
│   ├── raco-mcp/           # MCP protocol implementation
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src/

│   │       ├── git.rs      # Git operations
│   │       ├── rust.rs     # Rust toolchain
│   │       ├── debug.rs    # Debugging
│   │       └── lib.rs
│   │
│   ├── raco-cli/           # Command-line interface
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src/
│   │       └── main.rs     # CLI entry point
│   │
│   └── raco-web/           # Web interface

│       └── src/
│           ├── server.rs   # Web server
│           ├── api.rs      # API endpoints
│           └── main.rs     # Web app entry point
│
├── examples/               # Example workflows and usage
└── tests/                  # Integration tests
```

**Key characteristics:**

1. **Modular Design**: Each functional area has its own crate with clear responsibilities
2. **Dependency Management**: Each crate declares its own dependencies, minimizing unnecessary dependencies
3. **Compilation Efficiency**: Changes to one crate only require recompiling that crate and its dependents
4. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with focused modules
5. **Compatibility**: Enables different versions for different components if needed

The main workspace `Cargo.toml` will include:

```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "crates/raco-core",
    "crates/raco-mcp",
    "crates/raco-workflow",
    "crates/raco-servers",
    "crates/raco-cli",
    "crates/raco-web",
]

[workspace.dependencies]
# Shared dependencies with fixed versions
tokio = { version = "1.28", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"
tracing = "0.1"
# Add other common dependencies
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

RACO will use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery. The pipeline will ensure code quality, run tests, and build artifacts.

**Benefits of this CI/CD setup:**

1. **Code Quality Checks**:
   - Enforces code formatting with `cargo fmt`
   - Runs clippy for linting and catches common mistakes
   - Ensures all code builds successfully

2. **Testing**:
   - Runs unit and integration tests across the codebase
   - Tests all features and configurations

3. **Cross-platform Support**:
   - Builds and tests on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Creates platform-specific binaries for releases

4. **Documentation**:
   - Automatically builds and deploys Rust API docs and Sphinx documentation
   - Makes documentation available via GitHub Pages

5. **Release Automation**:
   - Creates GitHub releases with built binaries
   - Tags releases with versioning

### Development Environment

For consistent development environments, a `rust-toolchain.toml` file will be included to specify the Rust version and components:

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "stable"
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]
profile = "default"
```

Additionally, a `.cargo/config.toml` will provide useful defaults:

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["-D", "warnings"]

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# Linux-specific settings

[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
# macOS-specific settings

[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
# Windows-specific settings
```

## Framework Requirements Summary

The following enhancements to the mcp-agent-rs framework would facilitate RACO implementation:

1. **Dynamic Server Registry** - Support for runtime registration and discovery of MCP servers
2. **Workflow Engine Integration** - Better primitives for workflow definition and execution
3. **Transport Layer Improvements** - Enhanced support for various communication protocols
4. **Telemetry Integration** - Better support for metrics collection and reporting
5. **Security Enhancements** - Improved access control and encryption capabilities
6. **Formal Verification Support** - Integration with verification tools and verified components

If these features are not available in the current framework, they should be prioritized for contribution back to the mcp-agent-rs project to enhance the ecosystem.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Framework limitations | High | Early assessment of framework capabilities; contribute improvements where needed |
| Integration complexity | Medium | Start with simpler integrations; use mock interfaces for complex systems |
| Performance issues | Medium | Performance testing from early stages; optimize critical paths |
| User experience challenges | Medium | Early user testing with simple prototypes; iterative refinement |
| Scope creep | High | Strict adherence to requirements; regular review and prioritization |

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building RACO while ensuring alignment with requirements and architecture. By following this plan, we can deliver a functional demonstrator early while establishing a solid foundation for more advanced features. Regular review of the plan against progress and requirements will help ensure successful delivery.
