RACO Agent Architecture
===========================

Overview
========

The RACO (Ralf's AI Code Orchestrator) architecture is designed around a modular, extensible framework that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and provides both console and web-based interfaces for application development with AI assistance.

The architecture is built on the mcp-agent-rs framework, which provides core MCP functionality, and extends it with RACO-specific components for workflow management, code generation, and human-in-the-loop interactions.

Overall Architecture
===================

   :width: 100%

The diagram above illustrates the high-level components of the RACO architecture and their interactions. The architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns:

* **User Interfaces** - Provide interaction points for users through console and web interfaces
* **Core System** - Implements the workflow engine, MCP protocol integration, and human input handling
* **Application Development** - Contains components for code generation, analysis, testing, and documentation
* **Technical Services** - Provides cross-cutting concerns like telemetry, security, and state persistence

Workflow System
==============

   :width: 100%

The workflow system is the central orchestration mechanism in RACO, responsible for defining, executing, and tracking the progress of development tasks. It:

* Defines clear steps with dependencies and completion criteria
* Manages workflow state and persistence
* Supports various step types including code generation, analysis, testing, and human input
* Provides visualization of workflow state and progress

Human-in-the-Loop Flow
=====================

   :width: 100%

The human-in-the-loop flow is a key differentiator for RACO, enabling collaborative development between AI and human users. This sequence diagram shows:

* How user input is requested, validated, and incorporated into the workflow
* The approval process for AI-generated outputs
* How the workflow adapts based on human decisions
* The continuous progress reporting throughout the process

MCP Integration Architecture
==========================

.. uml:: _static/raco_mcp_integration.puml
   :alt: RACO MCP Integration
   :width: 100%

The MCP integration architecture shows how RACO leverages the Model Context Protocol to interact with AI models and external services:

* The MCP Protocol Layer provides client, message handling, transport, and server registry functionality
* The Dynamic Server Manager enables runtime addition and configuration of MCP servers
* External MCP servers provide specialized services for code context, documentation, testing, and web resources
* The integration architecture enables seamless communication with AI models and external resources

Development Environment Integration
=================================

.. uml:: _static/raco_development_environment.puml
   :alt: RACO Development Environment Integration
   :width: 100%

The development environment integration is a critical aspect of RACO, providing specialized tools for Rust development and debugging:

* **File Management Servers** - Provide filesystem and Git operations for code management
* **Build and Debugging Servers** - Enable Rust toolchain management and debugging on both host and QEMU Zephyr targets
* **System Integration Server** - Analyzes the host system to optimize repository setup and tool configuration
* **Dynamic Server Manager** - Allows for runtime addition and configuration of MCP servers

These components work together to provide a comprehensive development environment that adapts to the specific requirements of each project and development target.
