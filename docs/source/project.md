## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - FastAPI for API endpoints
  - Pydantic for data validation
  - OpenTelemetry for monitoring
  - Various AI model integrations (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere)
  - Temporal for workflow orchestration (optional)

## Build and Development Setup

1. **Package Management**:

   - Uses `uv` as the recommended package manager
   - Dependencies managed via `pyproject.toml`
   - Pre-commit hooks for code quality

2. **Development Tools**:

   - Ruff for linting
   - Pre-commit for git hooks
   - VSCode configuration included

3. **Common Commands**:

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

   # Run tests
   pytest

   # Run CLI
   mcp-agent
   ```

## Coding Style

- Follows Python best practices
- Type hints are used throughout the codebase
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Heavy use of Pydantic models for data validation
- Async/await patterns for concurrent operations

## Migration to Rust Considerations

### Advantages of Rust Migration

1. **Performance**:

   - Rust's zero-cost abstractions could improve execution speed
   - Better memory management and concurrency handling
   - Lower latency for API endpoints

2. **Safety**:

   - Rust's ownership system provides memory safety guarantees
   - Thread safety guarantees
   - Better error handling with Result types

3. **Modern Ecosystem**:
   - Strong async/await support
   - Excellent HTTP frameworks (Actix-web, Axum)
   - Great serialization libraries (Serde)

### Migration Strategy

1. **Core Components to Migrate**:

   - MCP protocol implementation
   - Agent execution engine
   - API endpoints
   - Data models (using Serde)

2. **Keep in Python**:

   - AI model integrations (unless Rust bindings are available)
   - CLI tools (can be kept in Python for easier maintenance)
   - Example implementations

3. **New Rust Structure**:

   ```
   src/
   ├── lib.rs           # Core library
   ├── mcp/            # MCP protocol
   ├── agent/          # Agent implementations
   ├── executor/       # Task execution
   ├── api/           # API endpoints
   └── models/        # Data models
   ```

4. **Dependencies to Consider**:
   - Actix-web or Axum for HTTP
   - Tokio for async runtime
   - Serde for serialization
   - SQLx or Diesel for database
   - OpenTelemetry Rust SDK

### Challenges and Considerations

1. **AI Integration**:

   - Need to evaluate Rust bindings for AI models
   - May need to maintain Python FFI for some integrations

2. **Learning Curve**:

   - Team needs Rust expertise
   - More complex error handling patterns

3. **Development Speed**:

   - Initial development might be slower
   - More explicit type system requires more upfront work

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Need to maintain Python tests during migration
   - Add Rust-specific tests
   - Integration tests between Python and Rust components

## Recommendations

1. **Gradual Migration**:

   - Start with core components
   - Keep Python API during transition
   - Migrate one module at a time

2. **Documentation**:

   - Maintain comprehensive API documentation
   - Document FFI interfaces
   - Update examples for both languages

3. **Performance Metrics**:

   - Establish baseline metrics in Python
   - Measure improvements in Rust
   - Focus on critical path optimization

4. **Team Training**:
   - Provide Rust training
   - Start with smaller Rust projects
   - Build internal Rust expertise
